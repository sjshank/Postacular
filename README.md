 An AngularJS framework based web application to add and bring back some posts from any API URL.
 
 How to run application ?
  Double click on landingPage.html. No need to setup any server.
  
  
 Note : This application will be access/run in firefox browser only.
        When you trying to run in chrome/ie it will give you "Cross origin request not supported error".
        This is because you are just opening html documents directly from the browser. To fix this you will need to serve your           code from a webserver and access it on localhost.
